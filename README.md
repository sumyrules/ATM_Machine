# ATM_Machine

The working code of the ATM Machine project as provided is available here: https://github.com/sumyrules/ATM_Machine
The implementation is done in Java.

The input file inputFile.txt is used as an input to the program. This is located under com/jnj/input. 
I have added a absolute path, so it should work without any changes. In case, there is an issue with the file not being found, it 
can be accessed under the above package. The values can be changed here and tested.

I have placed the documents - Class Diagram and the Test Execution Results under com/jnj/docs/

# Assumptions
1. I have assumed that the format of the input will not change. The code might not work, if there is a change in the input format.
2. I have created Customized Functional Exceptions in the code base, but have not used in the actual working of the code. In future, it is
important to have functional and technical exceptions defined in the code.

Please let me know if there are any issues that prevent the program from running successfully.

Thanks,

Sumanth
